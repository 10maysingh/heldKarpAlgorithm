        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p class="info">The Held–Karp algorithm, also called Bellman–Held–Karp
            algorithm, is a dynamic programming algorithm proposed in 1962
            independently by Bellman and by Held and Karp to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP), in which the input is a distance matrix
            between a set of cities, and the goal is to find a minimum-length
            tour that visits each city exactly once before returning to the starting point. It finds the exact solution to this problem, and to several
            related problems including the Hamiltonian cycle problem, in exponential time.<br>
            Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method
            and a computer programming method. The method was developed
            by Richard Bellman in the 1950s.</p>

        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <p>A School bus starting from School needs to visit all the specified bus
            stops, where the distance between all the stops are known and each
            bus stop needs to be visited once. What is the shortest possible route
            that the bus visit each stop exactly once and returns back to school?
            </p>

            <img src="bus.png" alt="bus">
        <br>
        <br>
        <h2>Proposed solution</h2><br><br><br>
        <p>The bus in this case has to visit each and every bus stop (node)
            exactly so once this Implies the bus is following the Hamiltonian
            path. But this problem is more complex than the Hamiltonian cycle
            as shortest path is also to be found. Given below graph depicts the
            five bus stops which the school bus has to travel. Bus has to start
            from the bus stop O(school), where many possible routes are possible
            to travel.</p>
